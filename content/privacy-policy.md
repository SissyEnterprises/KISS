<h2 id="what-data-do-we-collect">What data do we collect?</h2>

<p class="text-justify">We collect the following data:</p>

<p class="text-justify">
This project is radically serverless in its approach, no data is
sent our own servers in any way shape or form, nor do we share it
with third parties. All data is kept either offline or in cloud
storage owned by the user, and is only shared if the user gives
explicit permission to do so.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
As such, we don't actually collect data on our users, the
application has access to data on the user and builds up an
increasing understanding of the user, but we as a community have
no access to that data unless the user shares it willingly.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
It's important to note that since our application relies heavily
on the use of a users Google Account we cannot know nor guarantee
exactly what data Google collects on the user while on the site,
and the user should make sure they understand the privacy policy
related to their Google Account before using this application.
</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-collect-your-data">
How do we collect your data?
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
The user may provide data to us willingly. We do not collect it in
any sort of automated fashion.
</p>

<h2 id="how-will-we-use-your-data">How will we use your data?</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
We don't use your data. The application does.
</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-store-your-data">How do we store your data?</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
Data is only stored either in the users browser or in cloud
storage owned by the user. None is stored or collected by us.
</p>

<h2 id="marketing">Marketing</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
Marketing is an opt-in feature of the application. If given
permission it will periodically send emails to the user.
</p>
<p>
Users can always opt out from marketing by entering the marketing
section in their account settings.
</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-data-protection-rights">
What are your data protection rights?
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">As a user you have the following rights:</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to access – You have the right to request for copies of
your personal data. As we centrally have none we can't actually
give you any, but you have the right to request it.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we
correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have
the right to request us to complete the information you believe is
incomplete. We can't always do it however since we have no central
storage of your information, so most likely you're looking for
something in the account settings that we can't change for you, or
you should contact e.g. Google to change your account, but you
have the right to make a request anyway and we'll try to help you.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to erasure – You have the right to request that us to
erase your personal data, under certain conditions. However, since
we don't have any central storage of your data, the only place you
need to go to delete your data is in the data deletion section of
your account settings.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request
that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under
certain conditions. Not much we can do here either but you have
the right to request it.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to object to processing – You have the right to object
to us processing your personal data, under certain conditions. We
don't actually do any central processing, so this would mean you
have a problem with the app, which would means you're not happy
with the application, so our best recommendation if you object to
it is to leave us feedback so we can improve it, or stop using it.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The right to data portability – You have the right to request that
we transfer the data that we have collected to another
organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions. Again,
we don't have any centrally, but you can access all your data
collected by the application in the data management section of
your account settings.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you
would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us on
Github.
